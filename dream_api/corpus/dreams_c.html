<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
see a castle in your dream signifies reward, honor, recognition, and praise for
your achievements. You are destined to a position of power, wealth, and

life's daily problems.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
dream that you live in a castle represents your extreme need for security and
protection to the point where you may be isolating yourself from others. Perhaps
the dream parallels a waking situation where it&nbsp; has put you on the

<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
see a castle door in your dream indicates that you have missed a huge and/or

virility. You are feeling the pressures of your sexual performance.
Alternatively, it represents a lack of creativity, power or strength.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
see a cat in your dream symbolizes an independent spirit, feminine sexuality,
creativity, and power. It also represents misfortune and bad luck. The dream
symbol has different significance depending on whether you are a cat lover or
not. The cat could indicate that someone is being deceitful or treacherous
toward you. If the cat is aggressive, then it suggests that you are having
problems with the feminine aspect of yourself.&nbsp;If you are afraid of the cat
in your dream, then it suggests that you are fearful of the feminine. The dream
may be a metaphor&nbsp;for
&quot;cattiness&quot; or someone who is &quot;catty&quot; and malicious. If you
see a cat with no tail, then it signifies a loss of independence and lack of
autonomy.&nbsp;</font>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
dream that you cannot find your cat highlights your independent spirit. You need
to allow yourself to be free and not let anyone or anything hold you back.&nbsp;</font>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
dream that a cat is biting you symbolizes the devouring female. Perhaps you are
taking and taking without giving. You may be expressing some fear or frustration
especially when something is not going as planned. To dream that you are saving
the life of a cat implies that you are reclaiming your independence and power.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
dream that a cat is scratching you suggests that you are feeling threatened.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
see a black cat in your dream indicates that you are experiencing some fear in
using your psychic abilities and believing in your intuition. You may
erroneously associate the black cat with evil, destruction, and bad luck. In
particular, if the black cat is biting, clawing or attacking you, then the dream
means that you must acknowledge what your intuition is trying to tell you. You
can no longer ignore it. Do not be afraid to face the situation. If you see a
white cat, then it denotes difficult times.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
dream that a cat killed a spider suggests that you are expressing your
femininity in a seductive and cunning manner rather than in an overtly and
almost destructive way.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
see a dead cat or hear a cat being killed implies that you are lacking autonomy and
independence in some area of your life. Alternatively, the dream means that you
are refusing to recognize your feminine power.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
see cats playing in your dream refers to your frisky nature. You need to show
your playful side.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
see a cat with green spikes suggests that jealousy is preventing you from
forming meaningful relationships. You are keeping your distance from a situation
or relationship.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">To
see or drive a car that looks like a cat refers to your free and independent
spirit. If you are almost hit by a car that looks like a cat, then it suggests
that you are hindering someone's goals or not letting them be who they are.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">Dreaming
of a cat without a body or any legs symbolizes limited independence. You are
being mislead into thinking that you have the freedom to do whatever you
want.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">Seeing
two identical cats in your dream means that you need to balance your own needs

<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
