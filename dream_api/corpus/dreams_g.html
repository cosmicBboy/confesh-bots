about a matter. You have decided on the path you want to take to reach your
opportunities and goals. On the other hand, if you are closing the garage door,
then it suggests that you are putting off your goals for the sake of others
around you.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To dream that there is a homeless family living in your garage indicates that something is missing in your life. Perhaps you are headed in the wrong direction. Your current path is leaving you unfulfilled and unsatisfied.

<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
