<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">To
see the letter &quot;R&quot; in your dream suggests that you are in need of some
&quot;R &amp; R&quot; or some rest and relaxation.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5; margin-top: 10" align="left"><strong><font size="4" face="Arial">Rabbi</font></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">To
see a rabbi in your dream represents your attitudes about Judaism. The dream may
serve to reaffirm your faith and beliefs.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5; margin-top: 10" align="left"><strong><a name="Rabbit"><font size="4" face="Arial">Rabbit</font></a></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">To
see a rabbit in your dream signifies luck, magical power, and success. You have
a positive outlook on life. Alternatively, rabbits symbolize abundance, warmth,
fertility and sexual activity. Perhaps your sex life needs to be kept in check.
The dream can also be&nbsp;associated
with Easter time and your own personal memories of Easter.&nbsp;</font>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">In
particular, to see&nbsp;a white rabbit in your dream symbolizes faithfulness in
love. The white rabbit also serves as a guide to steer you toward the right
direction. To see a black rabbit in your dream refers to fear of intimacy.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">If
the rabbit is hopping in your dream, then it indicates fertility. You will be
surrounded by children. Alternatively, the dream may be analogous to your lack
of commitment and how you jump from one thing or another.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">If you dream that the
rabbit scratches or bites you,&nbsp; then it means that you need to pay more
attention to your personal relationship or love life. If the bunny bites your
toes, then it implies that this relationship is headed down the wrong direction.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font face="Arial"><font size="3">To

<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">To
dream that you are in a race represents your competitive spirit and how you tend
to measure yourself against others. Alternatively, this dream may mean that you
need to slow down and take a different course in life.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">If
you dream that you win a race, then it represents your full potential and your
ability to achieve your goals. You are feeling empowered and able to overcome
your obstacles and those who stand in your way.&nbsp;The dream gives you

see a race car in your dream symbolizes your hard driving and headstrong
attitudes. It may also reflect your competitive nature and the need to win.
Alternatively, the race may be a pun for your issues with &quot;race&quot; and
ethnicity.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">To
dream that you are driving a race car represents your fast paced lifestyle. You

see a racetrack in your dream represents life in the fast lane for you. The
tracks may be a metaphor for your quest to get ahead in life. Alternatively, the

dream that you&nbsp;are racist indicates your unwillingness and refusal to be
cast aside. You refuse to be dismissed.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">To
see an empty rack in your dream signifies your preoccupation with a problem that
has given you much anxiety. Perhaps, you are &quot;racking&quot; your brain for
an answer to a problem.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">To
see a rack of clothes in your dream represents your indecisiveness and self
doubt. You have a lot of lingering uncertainty.</font></p>
