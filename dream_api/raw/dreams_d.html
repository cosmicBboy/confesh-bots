<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
dream about the death of a loved one suggests that you are lacking a certain
aspect or quality that the loved one embodies. Ask yourself what makes this
person special or what you like about them. It is that very quality that you are
lacking in your own relationship or circumstances. Alternatively, the dream
indicates that whatever that person represents has no part in your own life
anymore.&nbsp;In particular, to dream about the death of your living parents indicates
that you are undergoing a significant change in your waking life. Your
relationship with your parents has evolved into a new realm.&nbsp;If you dream
about the death of a child, then it implies that you need to let go of your
immaturity and start being more serious. As your child reaches certain
milestones and grows into an adult, dreaming of their death may be symbolic of
their own self-discovery, transition and transformation into a new stage of
life.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To

dream that you die in your dream symbolizes inner changes, transformation,
self-discovery and positive development that is happening within you or your
life. You are undergoing a transitional phase and are becoming more enlightened
or spiritual. Although such a dream may bring about feelings of fear and
anxiety, it is no cause for alarm as it is often considered a positive symbol.&nbsp;
Dreams of experiencing your own death usually means that big changes are ahead
for you. You are moving on to new beginnings and leaving the past behind. These
changes does not necessarily imply a negative turn of events. Metaphorically,
dying can be seen as an end or a termination to your old ways and habits. So,
dying does not always mean a physical death, but an ending of something.<font size="3">
If you dream that someone is telling you that you are going die, then it implies
that you are being pressured to make an important change or choice. You are
about to embark on some new life adventure.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">If
a love one has past away, but you dream that he or she didn't really die that
first time and are being buried again indicates that this loved one was taken
before their time and you never got a chance to say a proper good bye. Perhaps
there was some unfinished issue that is still left lingering long after their
death. You wished you had a little more time with them.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">On a
negative note, to dream that you die may represent involvement in deeply painful
relationships or unhealthy, destructive behaviors. You may feeling depressed or
feel strangled by a situation or person in your waking life. Perhaps your mind
is preoccupied with someone who is terminally ill or dying. Alternatively, you
may be trying to get out of some obligation, responsibility or other situation.
You are desperately trying to escape from the demands of your daily life.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To
see someone dying in your dream signifies that your feelings for that person are
dead or that a significant change/loss is occurring in your relationship with
that person. Alternatively, you may want to repress that aspect of yourself that
is represented by the dying person. If you see a stranger die in your dream,
then it implies that you are feeling detached from the changes that are
happening around you.&nbsp;</font></p>
