<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">To

rights and opportunities for all.&nbsp; It also symbolizes honesty, loyalty, and
chivalry.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">To
dream that you are lying on a table indicates your need for nourishment and
relaxation. It relates to health concerns and anxieties about your well-being.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">To
dream that a table is walking or moving by itself signifies that you will
undergo some changes in your life which will relieve you of some
dissatisfaction.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><strong><font size="4" face="Arial">Table

<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font face="Arial"><font size="3">To</font>
see or play table tennis in your dream suggests that you are going back and
forth between two choices. You are confused over an important decision in your
life. Alternatively, the dream also indicates commitment issues. You are having
difficulty committing to a decision, to a relationship or social obligation.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><strong><font size="4" face="Arial">Tablecloth</font></strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">To
dream that you are being tackled represents obstacles that are standing in your
way toward your goals. Something or someone is preventing you from achieving
your goals.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><strong><font size="4" face="Arial">Tacks</font></strong></p>

confrontational and quarrelsome.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">To

<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">To
see or eat a taco in your dream signifies warmth and comfort. Consider the type
of taco shell, as this is analogous to your demeanor and attitude in your waking
life. If it is a hard shell taco, then it represents your brash and
&quot;hard&quot; exterior. If it is a soft shell taco, then it signifies your
adaptability and yielding persona.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><strong><font size="4" face="Arial">Tadpole</font></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">To

hard work.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">To
dream that you are playing tag represents your level of determination and
agility toward achieving your goals. If you are the one being chased, then the
dream means that you are trying to dodge some responsibility. If you are the one
who is doing the chasing, then it signifies your instincts and your
determination to go after what you want. The dream may be telling you that
&quot;you're it!&quot; You are the chosen one or the one that is chosen for the
job.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><strong><font size="4" face="Arial">Tail</font></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">To
see only the tail of an animal in your dream signifies annoyances and
complications in a situation where pleasure was expected. If the tail is
wagging, then it symbolizes excitement, thrills, and joy. If the tail is between
the legs, then it represents fear and humiliation. Alternatively, the dream
represents balance. Or it may&nbsp; be a pun on &quot;being tailed&quot; as in
being followed or chased.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">To
dream that you have grown a tail represents an aspect of the past that still
lingers with you.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">To
dream that you are ordering or eating takeout food implies that you are looking
for some sort of emotional support. You are not spending enough time confronting
your feelings or you have avoided your feelings for too
long. Alternatively, the dream may be a metaphor that there is something that
you need to &quot;take out&quot; or &quot;take away&quot; from your life.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">To
dream that you are dressed as a Chinese takeout container means that you are
lacking some sort of social life. Perhaps you want someone to take you
out.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><font size="4">Talent
Show<br>
</font></strong><font size="3">To dream that you are in a talent show indicates
that you are recognizing and using your potential and skills. You are
acknowledging your abilities and moving toward a new stage in your life.
Consider the reaction and behavior of the audience as they symbolize your social
circle and support system. If the audience reacts negatively, then it suggests
that your friends and family are not supportive of you. Conversely, if the
audience reacts positively, then it means that you have a support system to lean
on.<br>
<br>
To dream that you are watching a talent show suggests that you are not utilizing
your full potential. You are watching your own talents go to waste.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><strong><font size="4" face="Arial">Talisman</font></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 5" align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">To
dream that you are wearing a talisman indicates that you are in need of
protection. Sometimes you need to put away your pride and know when to ask for
outside help.</font></p>
