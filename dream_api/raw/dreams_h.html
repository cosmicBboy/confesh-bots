see hair in your dream signifies sexual virility, seduction, sensuality, vanity,
and health.&nbsp;It is indicative of your attitudes. If your hair is knotted or
tangled, then it is symbolic of uncertainty and confusion in your life. You may

issue in your waking life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To

before making some decision. You are concentrating on some plan or situation.&nbsp;Dreaming
that you have hair so long that it gets in your way suggests that your thoughts
and/or ideas are preventing you from moving forward. Perhaps you are doing too
much thinking and not taking action.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To

undertaking. You may be feeling weak and vulnerable.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">To

has just been made aware to you. It is a symbol of knowledge, wisdom and insight. The dream
may also be a metaphor suggesting that you are feeling &quot;light-headed&quot;.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8" align="left"><font face="Arial">Dreaming
of someone with black or raven hair refers to someone who is mysterious. If you
dream that you have black hair or that you are dying your hair black, then it

feelings.</font></p>
